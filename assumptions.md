To ease development, for now several assumptions are made about the device. Of course, the plan will be to reduce reliance on these assumptions as development furthers. As I make these assumptions (and discover the ones I made prior to assembling this list :P ) I will notate them here in order to a) serve as a todo list of blockers for running on any device and b) figure out what's missing should I find a device which doesn't work.

* VK1.3 OR maintenance4 (workgroup size specialization)
* dualSrcBlend (~100% on desktop)
* dynamicRendering
* multiDrawIndirect
